## Objective:
To analyze browser extensions (add-ons) and review their permissions to assess potential privacy and security implications.

---

## Task Overview:
- Analyzed installed Firefox extensions.
- Reviewed permissions granted to each extension.
- Evaluated the potential security or privacy risks involved.
- Learned how extensions interact with browser data and user activity.

---

## Extensions Analyzed:
### 1. **DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials**
- **Permissions**:
  - Access data for all websites
  - Access browser tabs
  - Access browser activity during navigation
- **Purpose**: Blocks trackers and enhances privacy by using DuckDuckGo’s tracker protection.

---

### 2. **Form History Control (II)**
- **Permissions**:
  - Access your data for all websites
  - Input data to clipboard
  - Display notifications
  - Access browser tabs
- **Purpose**: Allows user to manage, edit, and backup form data entries.

---

### 3. **FoxyProxy Standard**
- **Permissions**:
  - Access data for all websites
  - Clear browsing history, cookies
  - Download files, access and modify browser's download history
  - Display notifications
  - Control proxy settings
  - Access browser tabs
- **Purpose**: Advanced proxy management tool to configure and switch between proxies easily.

---

### 4. **uBlock Origin**
- **Permissions**:
  - Access data for all websites
  - Read and modify privacy settings
  - Access browser tabs
  - Access browser activity during navigation
- **Purpose**: Efficient ad blocker that enhances privacy and speeds up browsing.

---

## ❌ Extension Removed:
- **Read Aloud: A Text to Speech Voice Reader**
  - Removed as it was no longer in use.
  - Previously required access to `translate.google.com`, `piper.ttstool.com`, and optionally requested data access across websites.

---

## Observations & Learning:
- Many privacy tools require access to **all website data**, which can be a double-edged sword.
- Proxy tools like FoxyProxy gain deep control over browser settings and history.
- Minimalist blockers like uBlock Origin require broad access but use it responsibly.
- Some extensions require clipboard/data input permissions which can be **risky** if misused.
